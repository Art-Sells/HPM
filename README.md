## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Holds the highest price of an asset after its import or purchase limiting the erasure of its value thus introducing new mechanisms to help it achieve this feat: **[HPM Mechanics](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/blob/main/Mechanics.md)**

**HPM is a Bear Market obfuscating financial architecture that introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:**

- **Solid Marketplace: a marketplace in which asset prices either stagnate or increase. This is achieved through a Stablecoin<>Financial-Asset(or Crypto Asset) Market Automated Supplication System or [MASS](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/HPMCodeBase/MASS). In solid marketplaces, bear markets don't exist.**
- **Sloth Market: a market in which asset prices stagnate.**
