## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Records the highest price of an asset after its import or purchase limiting the erasure of an investmentâ€™s value thus introducing new mechanisms to help it achieve this feat: **[HPM Mechanics](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/blob/main/Mechanics.md)**

**HPM is a Bear Market obfuscating financial architecture that introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:**

- **Solid Marketplace: a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase. This is achieved through a Stablecoin-to-Financial-Asset(or Crypto Asset) Market Automated Supplication System or [MASS](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/MASS). In solid marketplaces, bear markets don't exist.**
- **Sloth Market: a market in which investments stagnate.**
