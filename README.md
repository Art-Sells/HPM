## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Records the highest price of an asset after its import or purchase limiting the erasure of an investmentâ€™s value.

**HPM is the world's first BMOFA or Bear Market Obfuscating Financial Architecture that introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:**

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase. This is achieved through a Stablecoin-to-Financial-Asset(or Crypto Asset) Market Automated Supplication System or [MASS](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/MASS). In solid marketplaces, bear markets don't exist.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.

### Liquid Marketplaces vs Solid Marketplaces

In liquid marketplaces, bull & bear market investments act cohesivelly (all investments rise & fall together) whereas in solid marketplaces, bull & sloth market investments act independently (each investment rises & stabilizes separately) just as liquid objects vs solid objects differ in their viscosities. This is better explained through individualized investment groups called Vatop Groups in: **[HPM Mechanics](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/blob/main/Mechanics.md)**
