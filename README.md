## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Holds the highest price of an asset after its initial decline in value thus eliminating bear markets.

**HPM is the world's first BMOFA or Bear Market Obfuscating Financial Architecture that introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:**

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase. This is achieved through a Stablecoin-to-Financial-Asset(or Crypto Asset) Market Automated Supplication System or [MASS](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/MASS). In solid marketplaces, bear markets don't exist.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.
