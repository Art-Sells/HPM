## HPM (Holding Price Mechanism)
Holds the highest price of an asset after its import or purchase limiting the erasure of its value thus introducing new mechanisms to help it achieve this feat: **[HPM Mechanics](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/blob/main/Mechanics.md)**

## The HPM mechanics introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamicsâ€¦

- **Solid Marketplace: a marketplace in which asset prices either stagnate or increase. This is achieved by constraining the flexibility of selling assets creating solidity in marketplaces. In solid marketplaces, bear markets don't exist.**
- **Sloth Market: a market in which asset prices stagnate.**
