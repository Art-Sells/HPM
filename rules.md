# Rules of Vavity

- **Psychology handles the meaning.**
- **Technology handles the rules.**

## Anchored Upward Limit

prevents:

- price hyperinflation
- runaway psychological valuation
- unbounded optimism or mania

## Self-Limiting

- Price cannot exceed external reference
- Price cannot fall below imports/purchases
- There is no mechanic that encourages runaway behavior (price hyper-inflation)

## Why Previous Systems Failed

Every failed psychological monetary system was self-amplifying:

- more trust → more issuance → more risk
- more hype → more exposure → greater collapse potential

## Why Vavity succeeds

- Autonomous systems have now made it possible to hard-code human psychology out of financial systems.

## Vavity's Autonomous Protections

Humans don't control the environment.

Human emotions don't alter the system.

Human fears don't introduce volatility.

Human panic doesn't affect others.

Human's only contribution is: **deciding whether to enter or wait.**

Once inside, the system protects humans from their own worst instincts by removing:

- loss realization
- fight-or-flight pressures

This makes Vavity:

- non-manipulable
- non-inflationary
- non-extractive
