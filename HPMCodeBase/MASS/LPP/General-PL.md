# Key Takeaways
- **Without LPP:** all investors endured ~10% downswings in June 2024 (BTC $67.7k â†’ $60.1k), though final P&Ls were strong (+68%).  
- **With LPP:** no major drawdowns; small realized losses (â€“0.8% daily, â€“1.2% weekly) clipped some entries, but final returns were still **+22â€“24%**.  
- **Daily vs Weekly:** after correction, both methods converge. Daily was slightly smoother (~22.2%) while weekly clocked in at ~23.7%.  
- **Design goal achieved:** LPP avoided bear-market pain, at the cost of giving up some upside vs straight DCA.
