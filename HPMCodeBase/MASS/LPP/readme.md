# LPP: Liquidity Pool Pollination

## üå± Overview

**Liquidity Pool Pollination (LPP)** is an autonomous algorithmic mechanism that harvests volatility between liquidity pools and migrates value across them efficiently. It uses automated supplication logic to navigate price divergence between different liquidity pools; a core innovation of the **[Market Automated Supplication System (MASS)](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/HPMCodeBase/MASS)**. 

---

MASS v1 observes weekly **median cbBTC prices** derived from two/three liquidity pools, simulates ¬±$100 divergence between pool prices, and dynamically determines when to:

- **Supplicate cbBTC** (convert USDC into cbBTC at the lower pool)
- **Supplicate USDC** (convert cbBTC into USDC at the higher pool)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è LPP Supplication Logic *(for MASS v1)*

**Based on a $5,000 cbBTC investment starting April 22, 2025.**

### Scenario:

- Start: Invest $5,000 in cbBTC on Apr 22 at 4pm.
- Supplicate USDC when the high pool price is higher and a dip from prior low pool high is confirmed.
- Hold for 7 days after USDC supplication.
- Supplicate cbBTC when low pool price rises above last USDC supplication.
- **Avoid losses** by holding USDC in sustained downtrends.

### Wallet Value (Bull vs Bear)

**Bull Market Wallet Value (with HPM-MASS v1):**
- **Total Gains:** `$198.96`
- **Total Losses:** `$10.52`
- **Net Profit:** `$188.44`
- **% Return:** `+3.77%`

**Bull Market Wallet Value (without HPM-MASS v1):**
- **Total Gains:** `$300.09`
- **Total Losses:** `$88.61`
- **Net Profit:** `$211.48`
- **% Return:** `+4.24%`

**Bear Market Wallet Value (with HPM-MASS v1):**
- **Total Gains:** `$63.46`
- **Total Losses:** `$0.00`
- **Net Profit:** `$63.46`
- **% Return:** `+1.27%`

**Bear Market Wallet Value (without HPM-MASS v1):**
- **Total Gains:** `$0.00`
- **Total Losses:** `$274.16`
- **Net Loss:** `$274.16`
- **% Return:** `-5.47%`

### In Summary:

LPP (using MASS v1) gives up a small portion of upside in exchange for no downside insulation built to render bear markets obsolete.
