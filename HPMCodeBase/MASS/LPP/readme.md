# LPP: Liquidity Pool Pollination

## üå± Overview

**Liquidity Pool Pollination (LPP)** is an autonomous algorithmic mechanism that harvests volatility between liquidity pools and migrates value across them efficiently. It uses automated supplication logic to navigate price divergence between different liquidity pools; a core innovation of the **[Market Automated Supplication System (MASS)](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/HPMCodeBase/MASS)**. 

---

MASS v1 observes weekly **median cbBTC prices** derived from two/three liquidity pools, simulates ¬±$100 divergence between pool prices, and dynamically determines when to:

- **Supplicate cbBTC** (convert USDC into cbBTC at the lower pool)
- **Supplicate USDC** (convert cbBTC into USDC at the higher pool)

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è LPP Supplication Logic

**Based on a $5,000 cbBTC investment.**

## Scenario

- **Apr 25:** Begin with **$5,000 worth of cbBTC** (not a supplication).
- **Supplicate USDC** when the **low pool price** drops below the **previous highest low pool price**.
- After supplicating USDC, **hold for 7 days**.
- After the 7-day hold, **supplicate cbBTC** if the **low pool price** exceeds the price at which USDC was obtained.
- Otherwise, maintain position (Hold).

## Wallet Value Progression

## Key Principles

- **No speculation:** MASS only responds to price divergence logic.
- **No market timing:** It does not predict. It reacts to pool price data only.
- **Supplications, not trades:** All conversions occur via controlled MASS mechanisms.
- **Invariant supply logic:** cbBTC and USDC are always 100% accounted for.

## Result

- **Losses:** `$0.00`
- **Profits:** `$616.64`
- **% Return:** `+12.33%` over 4 weeks
