# LPP: Liquidity Pool Pollination (based on MASS v1)

## üå± Concept Overview

**Liquidity Pool Pollination (LPP)** is a core innovation of the **Market Automated Supplication System (MASS)**. It uses automated supplication logic to navigate price divergence between cbBTC liquidity pools.

MASS observes weekly **median cbBTC prices** derived from two liquidity pools, simulates ¬±$100 divergence between pool prices, and dynamically determines when to:

- **Supplicate cbBTC** (convert USDC into cbBTC at the lower pool)
- **Supplicate USDC** (convert cbBTC into USDC at the higher pool)

LPP is not a trading strategy‚Äîit is an autonomous algorithmic mechanism that harvests volatility between liquidity pools and migrates value across them efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supplication Logic (example)

- Begin with **$5,000 USDC**.
- On week 1: **Supplicate cbBTC** at the **lower pool price**.
- Each following week:
  - If **cbBTC is held** and the **high pool price exceeds prior week‚Äôs median**, then **supplicate USDC**.
  - If **USDC is held** and the **low pool price drops below prior week‚Äôs median**, then **supplicate cbBTC**.
  - Otherwise, maintain position (Hold).

## üß† Key Principles of LPP

- **No speculation:** MASS only responds to price divergence logic.
- **No market timing:** It does not predict. It reacts to pool price data only.
- **Supplications, not trades:** All conversions occur via controlled MASS mechanisms.
- **Invariant supply logic:** cbBTC and USDC are always 100% accounted for.

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

- **Start (Apr 25):** Supplicated cbBTC with $5,000 ‚Üí wallet value: `$5,005.74`
- **May 2:** Supplicated USDC ‚Üí wallet grew to `$5,407.96`
- **May 16:** Supplicated cbBTC ‚Üí wallet value: `$5,413.18`
- **May 21:** Supplicated USDC again ‚Üí wallet reached **$5,616.64**

## üìä Result

- **Total Growth**: `$616.64`
- **% Return**: `+12.33%` over 4 weeks
- **Mechanism**: Zero-fee value migration using price divergence
