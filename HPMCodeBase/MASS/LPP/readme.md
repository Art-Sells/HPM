# LPP: Liquidity Pool Pollination

## üå± Overview

**Liquidity Pool Pollination (LPP)** is an autonomous algorithmic mechanism that harvests volatility between liquidity pools and migrates value across them efficiently. It uses automated supplication logic to navigate price divergence between different liquidity pools; a core innovation of the **[Market Automated Supplication System (MASS)](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/HPMCodeBase/MASS)**. 

---

MASS v1 observes weekly **median cbBTC prices** derived from two/three liquidity pools, simulates ¬±$100 divergence between pool prices, and dynamically determines when to:

- **Supplicate cbBTC** (convert USDC into cbBTC at the lower pool)
- **Supplicate USDC** (convert cbBTC into USDC at the higher pool)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è LPP Supplication Logic *(example)*

**Based on a $5,000 cbBTC investment *(from April 25th 25' to May 22nd 25')*.**

Scenario:
- Begin with **$5,000 worth of cbBTC**..
- Each following week:
  - If **cbBTC is held** and the **high pool price exceeds prior week‚Äôs median**, then **supplicate USDC**.
  - If **USDC is held** and the **low pool price drops below prior week‚Äôs median**, then **supplicate cbBTC**.
  - Otherwise, maintain position (Hold).

### Wallet Value Progression

### Key Principles

- **No speculation:** MASS only responds to price divergence logic.
- **No market timing:** It does not predict. It reacts to pool price data only.
- **Supplications, not trades:** All conversions occur via controlled MASS mechanisms.
- **Invariant supply logic:** cbBTC and USDC are always 100% accounted for.

### Result

- **Losses**: `$0.00`
- **Profits**: `$616.64`
- **% Return**: `+12.33%` over 4 weeks
