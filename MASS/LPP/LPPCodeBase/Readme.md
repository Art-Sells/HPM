## Overview
This repository is currently in the **trial & error** stage of its development.  
The codebase is experimental and under heavy iteration. Core logic, architecture, and strategies are being tested, measured, and refined before production-ready patterns are finalized.

## Current Goals
- Explore multiple approaches to **fee-free** supplications.
- Run **trial experiments** with tick-level liquidity, quote simulations, and rounding edge cases.
- Validate whether **novel routing, pool mechanics, or protocol interactions** can eliminate costs during supplications.
- Collect empirical results from **live tests** to determine which hypotheses hold up under real network conditions.

## Development Style
- **Rapid prototyping**: Code is written to test hypotheses quickly, not yet optimized for cleanliness or efficiency.
- **Iterative refinement**: Failed experiments are part of the process; useful insights are recorded and guide the next design step.
- **Open-ended innovation**: Assumptions are constantly challenged. Even features considered “hardcoded” are being probed for creative workarounds.

## Expectations
- **Instability**: Features may break, change shape, or be removed as trials evolve.
- **Incomplete coverage**: Not all scenarios are fully supported yet.
- **High learning value**: Each trial, whether successful or not, provides insight into the system’s limits and new angles for innovation.

## Next Steps
- Use results to converge on strategies that balance **instant conversions** with **minimal or zero effective fees**.
- Transition from trial scripts toward a **stable, reusable architecture** once viable paths are identified.

⚠️ **Note:** This repository should not be considered production-ready. It is a **sandbox for innovation**, where experiments are intentionally pushed beyond conventional assumptions.
