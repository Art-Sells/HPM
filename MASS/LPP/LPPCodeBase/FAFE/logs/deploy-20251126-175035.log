(node:68232) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/Jeyak1/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com%7Eapple%7ECloudDocs/Documents/Arells/People/HPM/MASS/FAFE/FAFECodeBase/Infrastructure/scripts/deploy.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/Jeyak1/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/Arells/People/HPM/MASS/FAFE/FAFECodeBase/Infrastructure/package.json.
