# LPP: Liquidity Pool Pollination

## Overview

**Liquidity Pool Pollination (LPP)** is an autonomous algorithmic mechanism that harvests volatility between liquidity pools and migrates value across them efficiently. It uses automated supplication logic to navigate price divergence between different liquidity pools; a core innovation of the **[Market Automated Supplication System (MASS)](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/tree/main/MASS)**. 

#### Bear Market Investments

- **With HPM:** +0.009%-1%~ minimum profits, 0% losses.
- **Without HPM:** -100% maximum losses.

*For more info, see **[LPP v1 Expanded Results](https://github.com/Art-Sells/HPM/blob/main/MASS/LPP/v1Results.md
)***

---

MASS v1 observes weekly **median cbBTC prices** derived from two/three liquidity pools, simulates Â±$100 divergence between pool prices, and dynamically determines when to:

- **Supplicate cbBTC** (convert USDC into cbBTC at the lower pool)
- **Supplicate USDC** (convert cbBTC into USDC at the higher pool)

---

## LPP v1 Scenario *(for MASS v1)*

*The below scenario is based on publicly available prices (which display by hours (and not seconds)).*

**Real MASS v1 USDC supplications activate with every minor price downswing (seconds and not hours) thus real losses will be much more negligible.**

### Scenario:

- Start: Invest $5,000 in cbBTC on Apr 22 at 4pm.
- Supplicate USDC when the high pool price is higher and a dip from prior low pool high is confirmed.
- Hold for 7 days after USDC supplication.
- Supplicate cbBTC when low pool price rises above last USDC supplication.
- **Avoid losses** by holding USDC in sustained downtrends.

### Investment Value (Bull vs Bear (April 25' - May 25' prices)):

### With HPM-MASS-LPP v1
- **Bull Return:** `+3.77%`
- **Bear Return:** `+0.009%`
- **Profits:** `+3.779%`

### Without HPM-MASS-LPP v1
- **Bull Return:** `+4.24%`
- **Bear Return:** `-5.47%`
- **Losses:** `-1.23%`

### In Summary:

LPP v1 (using MASS v1) gives up a small portion of upside during bull markets in exchange for virtually no downsides in bear markets thus rendering bear markets obsolete.
